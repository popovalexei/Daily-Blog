Usage:

The Daily Blog project is designed to make it easy for users to create and publish their own blog posts. Here are some of the main features of the project:

  • Home Page: The home page displays all of the blog posts in chronological order. Each post is truncated to 100 characters, and users can click on the       "Read More" button to view the full post on a separate page.
  
  • Compose Post: Users can create new blog posts by clicking on the "Compose" button in the navigation bar. This will take them to a new page where they       can enter the title and content of their post. Once they submit their post, it will be added to the home page and a new page will be created for that       post (accessible at localhost:3000/posts/nameOfThePost).
  
  • About Us: The About Us page provides information about the Daily Blog project and the team behind it.
  
  • Contact Us: The Contact Us page allows users to send messages to the Daily Blog team.
  
  
  
All the pages in the Daily Blog project are designed using EJS templates and have a consistent design using Bootstrap, which makes the website look professional and cohesive.

Overall, the Daily Blog project showcases my skills in full-stack web development and highlights my ability to create user-friendly and visually appealing websites and applications.
